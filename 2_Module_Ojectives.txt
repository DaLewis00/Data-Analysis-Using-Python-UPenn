Students will get experience using pandas, an industry-standard data analysis library, 
to load and query real-world data and to answer questions about that data. 
This module demonstrates how to do advanced filtering and indexing,

and do basic computations over the data. 
Includes how to build a simple recommendation system, and approaches for cleaning data, 
dealing with missing values, and creating new data.
